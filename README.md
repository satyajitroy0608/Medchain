Blockchain to secure Medical Records

Background: Right now there is no efficient & secure system to maintain patient’s
health records. Prescriptions are handed out in paper which can be easily forged. There
is no system which accumulates all the medical records of a person in a secure manner
& gives a complete history of a patient’s medical record.


What to do:
Build a secure blockchain network to store the medical records of patients. These
records need to be immutable and tamper-free and can be accessed by users only after
proper authorization.
